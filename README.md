# Ludum Dare Disclaimer

This is my entry for the Ludum Dare 53 compo. Everything has been developed in 48 hours. It will be full of bugs, can't do much about that.

# Introduction

Welcome to Pet Delivery! 

Animal parents are waiting for the arrival of their pets. Will you be able to help them?

# How to play

* Click the mouse button and drag to aim the launch
* Release the mouse button to slingshot the pet towards his destiny
* Each level requires a pre-defined amount of deliveries to be accomplished (shown at the top-left of the screen)
* Try to get through all 10 levels and earn as many points as possible
* Please note that the trajectory helper is only available in the first three levels, then you will be on your own

# Score rules

* Each successful delivery earns 3 points.
* If you deliver a pet to the wrong parents, you will still get 1 point.
